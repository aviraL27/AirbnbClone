Airbnb Clone is a static frontend project built using HTML5 and CSS3 that recreates the layout of Airbnb’s homepage. It includes a navigation bar with a search section, property listings grouped by different cities, card-based hotel layouts with images and pricing, and a structured footer with support and company links. The project focuses on practicing Flexbox layouts, spacing, and clean UI structure without using JavaScript or any frameworks, making it ideal for strengthening core frontend fundamentals.
